# Dataset will be download automatically 
## CiFar-100 Datasets
We evaluate our approach on the commonly used benchmark datasets
for T -split class-incremental learning where the entire dataset is divided into T
disjoint susbsets or tasks
*CIFAR100 (20 Tasks)* datasets will be automatically downloaded and extracted to `./data` if they do not exist  


## Run command

``python main.py --config ./configs/config_cifar100.yml`` 


You can also manually download the dataset through the link below
